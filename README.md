##Task
To build a simple static website so that customer can get a rough idea of the hotel's history and it's famous dishes.


##Summary
This website represents information about various dishes, price list and special chef selection dishes. There are some honest customer reviews avaiable. It took me around 15-20 days. It is responsive which mean it is applicable to any device.As it is an simple static website I used little bit of JAVASCRIPT, HTML5, CSS3.
